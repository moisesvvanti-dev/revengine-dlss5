One button that sets up the **leaked DLSS 5 neural-rendering build** in any DirectX 11/12 game, with or without DLSS of its own. Single native Windows exe, no runtime. Everything it installs is downloaded from the projects that made it; the only third-party content inside the exe is three SIL-OFL fonts.

Download: [latest release](https://github.com/moisesvvanti-dev/revengine-dlss5/releases/latest) → `revengine-dlss5.exe`.

## Two paths, picked automatically

| The game | What gets installed |
|---|---|
| **Ships its own DLSS** (an `nvngx_dlss.dll` this tool did not place, or Streamline `sl.*.dll`, `nvngx_dlssg/dlssd.dll`, anywhere up to four folders deep, or under an Unreal project's `Plugins` tree) | ReShade add-on build + the DLSS 5 add-on (`renodx-dlss5.addon64`, `nvngx_dlssnr.dll`). The add-on hooks the game's own NGX calls directly. **DX11 games** also get [dlss5-bridge](https://github.com/NIGos/dlss5-bridge), which replays the D3D11 DLSS calls on a private D3D12 device so the add-on can see them. No Feeder, no LumeniteFX; a Feeder left over from an earlier run is removed. |
| **Has no DLSS** | The full Feeder path below: ReShade + shader headers + DLSS5-Feeder + LumeniteFX + the DLSS 5 add-on + config. |

**Engine choice for games with native DLSS** (two cards at the top of the window, the second one greyed out with a reason when the game has no DLSS): the default engine is ReShade + the RenoDX add-on. A second engine — [Dagherbou's OptiScaler_DLSSNR fork](https://github.com/Dagherbou/OptiScaler_DLSSNR) (OptiScaler with a built-in Neural Rendering pass, colour composition from RenoDX under MIT) — can be picked in the GUI or with `--engine=opti`: the tool extracts the fork's release into the game as `dxgi.dll`, adds `nvngx_dlssnr.dll`, and records a manifest so Remove takes it out cleanly. In game, Insert opens the OptiScaler overlay; Neural Rendering is off by default there. The two engines cannot share a game (both load as dxgi.dll). Note the fork targets the unpatched model: on the driver's own DLL that means RTX 50; with the `310.8.SF` model this tool installs, older RTX generations may work but are untested there.

**RenoDX HDR mod (optional, since 0.8.0; engine-independent since 0.8.1).** The [RenoDX](https://github.com/clshortfuse/renodx) project publishes game-specific HDR / tone-mapping mods as ReShade add-ons (`renodx-<game>.addon64`). When the tool recognises the game (Steam app id from the library's `appmanifest_*.acf`, else the folder / exe name, matched against RenoDX's `games-index.json` and its wiki mod list), a **RenoDX HDR mod** checkbox appears with the mod's status (working / in progress) and the wiki's note for that game; `--renodx` does the same on the command line. It loads beside the DLSS 5 add-on: ReShade only refuses two add-ons with the same name, and the game mods register as "RenoDX" while the DLSS 5 add-on registers as "DLSS 5 Neural Rendering"; their settings live in different `ReShade.ini` sections (`[renodx-preset1]` vs `[RenoDX.DLSS5]`). Verified in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Dragon's Dogma 2 (both add-ons registered in `ReShade.log`). Exactly **one** RenoDX game mod per game — a second one is refused by ReShade and both would write the same keys — so the tool refuses when another `renodx-*.addon64` is already there, and Remove only deletes the one it recorded. The link the wiki gives (often a maintainer's fork snapshot) wins over the main-repo snapshot build; games the wiki lists as Nexus/Discord-only get the snapshot build with a note. Turn Windows AutoHDR / RTX HDR off with these mods (double tone mapping). The generic Unreal/Unity fallbacks RHI offers are deliberately not installed. The checkbox is independent of the engine: on the **OptiScaler engine** the mod still needs ReShade, so the tool adds the ReShade DLL as `ReShade64.dll` and sets `[Plugins] LoadReshade=true` in `OptiScaler.ini` — the method OptiScaler's own ini documents for running ReShade add-ons beside it. That combination follows the documentation but has not been run in a game by the author; if it crashes, untick the mod or switch engines.

**RE Engine games** (Resident Evil 2/3/4/7/8/Requiem, Devil May Cry 5, Monster Hunter Rise/Wilds, Street Fighter 6, Dragon's Dogma 2, Pragmata — anything with `re_chunk_000.pak` next to the exe) crash under ReShade unless praydog's [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework) is loaded first. Since 0.8.0 the tool installs its monolithic nightly `dinput8.dll` as the first step in those games (only the DLL, as its release notes insist) and Remove takes it out again; a `dinput8.dll` the tool did not place is left alone.

**Wrong path?** The DLSS detection is a folder scan, so a stray `nvngx_dlss.dll` (left by another tool, or by this one before it started marking its own copy) makes a game without DLSS look like a native-DLSS game. The dropdown next to the game line (**Auto / Force no-DLSS (Feeder) / Force native DLSS**), `--mode=feeder|native`, or `REVENGINE_DLSS5_MODE` overrides it; the auto line still shows what was detected.

**Hybrid machines (laptop iGPU + dGPU, or an AMD/Intel display adapter alongside the NVIDIA card).** Windows decides which GPU a process starts on, and a process started on the integrated GPU has no NGX at all — every `NVSDK_NGX_D3D12_Init` answers `0xBAD00001` (FeatureNotSupported) no matter how correct the install is. Install now writes the same preference the Settings app writes (`GpuPreference=2;` under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\DirectX\UserGpuPreferences`) for the game exe, and for `host64\dlss5-feed-host64.exe` on a 32-bit game. Remove takes it away again, but only when it is still exactly what was written. `--check` prints the machine's adapters and the current preference.

DX11 vs DX12 is read from the exe's import table, then from the engine DLLs next to it (`UnityPlayer.dll`, ...), and a `D3D12\D3D12Core.dll` (DirectX Agility SDK redist) next to the exe counts as DX12 even when only `d3d11.dll` is imported (RE Engine). When nothing says, DX12 is assumed and the status line says so. `revengine-dlss5.exe "<game folder>" --check` prints the detected mode, API and plan without installing anything.

### The no-DLSS path

**Every component is taken from its project's latest release.** For DLSS5-Feeder that can be a tag named `-beta`: upstream publishes builds it means people to run with `prerelease=false` (v0.13.1-beta.1, v0.12.1-beta.2) while flagging the ones it does not, and those carry fixes the last plain-numbered release lacks. Install names the tag it took, with `(beta)` after it, so you always know what you are running.

It does, in order, exactly what the [DLSS5-Feeder README](https://github.com/jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder#install-for-a-64-bit-game) tells you to do by hand:

| Step | What | From |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ReShade **with add-on support**, dropped as `dxgi.dll` | `ReShade_Setup_<ver>_Addon.exe` on [reshade.me](https://reshade.me) (DLL pulled straight out of the installer, nothing is run) |
| 2 | `ReShade.fxh`, `ReShadeUI.fxh`, `DrawText.fxh` into `reshade-shaders\Shaders` (the setup exe has only the DLLs; every shader below includes `ReShade.fxh`) | [crosire/reshade-shaders](https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/tree/slim/Shaders) (`slim` branch) |
| 3 | `dlss5-feed.addon64` + `DLSS5_Feed.fx` | [jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder](https://github.com/jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder/releases/latest) |
| 4 | Motion-vector provider: `lumenite_*.fx`, `include\*.fxh`, `lumenite_bluenoise256.png` | [umar-afzaal/LumeniteFX](https://github.com/umar-afzaal/LumeniteFX) (`mainline` branch) |
| 5 | `renodx-dlss5.addon64` (the leaked DLSS 5 add-on, closed-source and community-distributed), `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` (its neural-rendering model), `nvngx_dlss.dll` (DLSS runtime; the Feeder's NGX session fails without one next to the game, so it is always placed and marked with a `nvngx_dlss.dll.revengine-dlss5` sidecar) | [RankFTW/rhi-repo](https://github.com/RankFTW/rhi-repo/releases) releases (`renodx-dlss5-*`, `dlssnr-*`, `dlss-*`) |
| 6 | `ReShade.ini` gets `PreprocessorDefinitions=DLSS5_MV_PROVIDER=3`; `ReShadePreset.ini` enables `Lumenite_Kernel` **above** `DLSS5_Feed` | written by this tool, existing keys preserved |

Every file is downloaded from its upstream at install time; a re-run only fetches what is missing.

## Use

1. Run `revengine-dlss5.exe` (single native binary, no runtime needed).
2. The **Games** page lists every installed game it can find — Steam (all library folders), Epic Games, GOG and Xbox / Game Pass — newest install first, with the store's own artwork (Steam's cached library art or its CDN, Xbox's tile logo, the exe icon otherwise) and, once inspected, a DirectX 11/12 chip plus "DLSS / add-on" status per card. Click a poster to open its **Setup** page. **Add a folder** / **Add a game** still take any folder or exe by hand, and a game added that way is remembered: it comes back in an **Added by you** section at the top of the list on every later start (right-click its card to forget it). **Rescan** re-reads the stores. `--list-games` prints the same list headless.
3. On the Setup page, pick the game's **folder** (or its `.exe`) - the game exe is detected automatically (the folder and two levels below it are searched, so `bin\x64_dx12\` and Unreal `Binaries\Win64\` layouts work; Unity crash handlers, Unreal helpers and redist installers are skipped; a `*-Shipping.exe` is preferred). If several candidates remain, a dropdown lets you choose. The list shows what is already present.
3. **Install DLSS 5**.
4. In game: **Home** opens ReShade → **Add-ons** tab → **DLSS 5 Neural Rendering** panel → enable it. Keep the game's MSAA/SSAA off. On games with their own DLSS the Home tab says "No effect files found" — expected, no shaders are needed there; the panel lives on the Add-ons tab.

**F6** toggles neural rendering on/off, **F5** saves the add-on's screenshot (both are the add-on's own hotkeys). On the Feeder path, `dlss5-feed.log` next to the game exe should show `feature ready … DLAA` and `DLSS5_MV_PROVIDER=3 (LumeniteFX Kernel) -> Lumenite_Kernel (enabled)`.

CLI: `revengine-dlss5.exe "C:\Games\Foo"` (folder or exe) / `--renodx` (also install the game's RenoDX HDR mod) / `--check` (detect only, also names the RenoDX mod it would install) / `--diagnose` (read the game's ReShade/feed logs and say why neural rendering is or is not running) / `--remove` (headless, prints progress).

## Updates

On start the tool looks at `github.com/moisesvvanti-dev/revengine-dlss5/releases/latest` (a redirect, no API) in the background. If a newer version exists, a bar offers **Update / Later / Skip this version**; nothing is downloaded unless you press Update. Update fetches the release exe, checks it is a real executable, swaps it in place of the running one (the old file is kept as `revengine-dlss5.exe.old` until the next start) and restarts. `revengine-dlss5.exe --update` does the same from the command line.

## Downloads and GitHub

Every component comes from GitHub releases. Since 0.5.1 the tool reads the public release **pages** (no API), so it is not subject to GitHub's 60-requests-per-hour API cap that caused `HTTP 403 Forbidden` for people installing into many games. If you set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable it is used for the API path first. Where github.com itself is unreachable (some countries block it), a proxy or VPN is the only way — the files exist nowhere else this tool trusts.

## GPU support

The tool reads the installed display adapters from the registry and refuses up front on anything that cannot run the model: non-NVIDIA cards (NGX does not exist there) and NVIDIA cards without tensor cores (GTX/GT/MX). Among RTX cards, expect very different costs — the DLSS 5 model is FP8 with RTX-50-only kernels; the `310.8.SF` build the tool installs adds patched binaries for RTX 40 and an FP16 path for RTX 20/30. The status line shows the tier: RTX 50 full speed · RTX 40 moderate cost · RTX 20/30 heavy cost. Virtual/remote adapters (Hyper-V GPU-P, RDP, VMs) are treated as unknown and allowed. If your card is misdetected, set `DLSS5ONECLICK_SKIP_GPU_CHECK=1` to bypass the refusal.

## Verifying a download

Each release's notes carry the SHA-256 of the attached `revengine-dlss5.exe`. Check yours with `certutil -hashfile revengine-dlss5.exe SHA256` (or PowerShell `Get-FileHash`). Only this repository's Releases page and the linked Nexus Mods page are legitimate sources — "DLSS 5 manager/one-click" executables from other repositories, videos or websites are not this tool, and at least one such repository distributes a 500 MB binary with no source at all.

## Windows Defender / SmartScreen

The exe is not code-signed (no publisher certificate), it is new, and it downloads DLLs into game folders — three things Windows heuristics dislike. Expect a SmartScreen "unknown publisher" prompt; if Defender quarantines the exe or, worse, the add-on files it placed in a game, restore them from Protection history, add the game folder as an exclusion, and re-run Install (it re-fetches only what is missing). Every release is built from the public source in this repository.

## Known issues

- **Feeder path + exclusive fullscreen.** Every focus change (alt-tab) makes the game recreate its swapchain; DLSS5-Feeder rebuilds its DLSS feature and can crash inside `CreateFeature` on that rebuild ([Feeder issue #16](https://github.com/jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder/issues/16), upstream). The game keeps rendering, DLSS 5 stops. Use borderless/windowed; raising `create_delay` in `dlss5-feed.cfg` helps. Seen on Fell & Sell; the same game ran 16,000+ frames without a crash in borderless. On a fresh install this tool writes `dlss5-feed.cfg` beside the exe with `create_delay=600` — the value the Feeder's own issue #16 found stops that rebuild crash — while leaving every other key at its upstream default (an existing config is never touched).
- **Frame cost.** Neural rendering at native 4K adds several milliseconds. With v-sync on at 60 Hz that shows up as a hard drop to 30 fps. Turn v-sync off, or lower `work_resolution` in `dlss5-feed.cfg` (Feeder path, D3D11 games). The neural model runs every frame regardless — there is no way to remove the cost entirely without disabling the feature; `work_resolution` is the FPS-vs-sharpness lever and is left at 100 by default so nothing here silently degrades quality.
- **API detection can come back unknown** (monolithic Unreal exes load D3D at runtime, nothing static to read). The tool then assumes DX12 and says so; a DX11 game in that state would miss the bridge. `--check` shows what was detected.
- The DLSS 5 add-on and its model are a leaked, closed-source build. The tool downloads whatever the rhi-repo releases currently host and cannot vouch for them.

## Not handled

- **32-bit games** are handled since 0.10.0 (beta, Feeder path only): the Feeder's `dlss5-feed.addon32` and a 32-bit ReShade go beside the exe, and a `host64\` folder gets `dlss5-feed-host64.exe`, a 64-bit ReShade, the DLSS 5 add-on and the two NVIDIA DLLs — the layout the [Feeder README](https://github.com/jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder#install-for-a-32-bit-game-beta) describes. The 32-bit add-on supports Direct3D 11 only; the helper's DLSS 5 panel is shown inside the game from the Feeder's Add-ons page. Verified here only as a file layout, not in a game — reports welcome on #17.
- **DirectX 9** and **Vulkan** games — different proxy / a Vulkan layer; refused.
- Online games — the tool refuses when it finds Easy Anti-Cheat, BattlEye or GameGuard files in the install (ReShade add-on injection is exactly what they flag: kick at best, ban at worst). Overwatch, Valorant and League (Blizzard/Riot anti-cheat, no marker files) are refused by exe name; Overwatch additionally blocks unsigned DLLs, so add-ons fail there with error `0x80090006`. Some games let you switch the anti-cheat off for offline play (GTA V: untick *Enable BattlEye* in the Rockstar Games Launcher, or launch with `-nobattleye`; Rockstar's own FAQ says BattlEye is only needed for GTA Online). For those, a checkbox under the warning — or `--ignore-anticheat` on the command line, or `DLSS5ONECLICK_IGNORE_ANTICHEAT=1` — installs anyway, at your own risk: do it only if the anti-cheat really is off, and never take that install online.

## Development

Rust 2021, single crate. GUI is egui/eframe; HTTP is reqwest (rustls); archives via the `zip` crate.

```
cargo test
cargo build --release   # target/release/revengine-dlss5.exe
```

Tests use local fakes only; no network. Verified 2026-08-31: full live installs against dummy game folders (both paths), and detection against real installs — Fell & Sell (Unity, DX11, no DLSS → Feeder), Fatal Claw (Unreal, DX11 + DLSS → native + bridge), Mortal Shell 2 (Unreal + DLSS → native), The Witcher 3 (`bin\x64_dx12`, native DX12), Jotunnslayer and Trails in the Sky (DX11 + DLSS → native + bridge). DLSS 5 confirmed running in Fell & Sell (`feature ready … DLAA`, NR evaluating, F6 toggling).
